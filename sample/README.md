Kotlin/Native GTK bindings preview
======

This is a preview sample of a GTK wrapper library for Kotlin/Native

To test it open project from `CMakeLists.txt` in CLion with Kotlin/Native plugin installed.

Then run `main` function from `main.kt`

It is only tested on Ubuntu 18.04, other distributions and OS will be supported in the future.

Don't forget to install GTK dev dependencies before:
`sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev`
